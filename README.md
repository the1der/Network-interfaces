# Network-interfaces
Network Interface Finder
This C++ code is a utility that discovers and retrieves information about network interfaces on both Windows and UNIX systems. It aims to provide a simple and convenient way to obtain a list of network interfaces along with their associated IP addresses.

The Network Interface Finder code leverages the capabilities of C++ and operating system-specific libraries to achieve its purpose. It utilizes the Winsock library on Windows systems and the POSIX sockets library on UNIX systems to access network-related information.

Upon execution, the code will enumerate all available network interfaces and retrieve their corresponding IP addresses. It works by querying the operating system's network stack to gather relevant data.

The output of the program is presented in a user-friendly format, displaying the name of each network interface along with its associated IP address. The provided information can be useful for network diagnostics, configuration, or any application that requires knowledge of available network interfaces and their IP addresses.
